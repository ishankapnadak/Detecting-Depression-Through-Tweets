## Welcome!
As part of our course project for the course DS203, we (Thomas Jacob and Ishan Kapnadak) built a sentiment classifier that looks at a person's recent tweets and marks them as being at risk of depression by looking for markers of depression that the classifier learns over time. We have compared various neural network architectures including CNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, and have also compared various embeddings including word, character, and subword-level embeddings. The report below contains details about our work, the results we obtained and future improvements.
