# Detecting-Depression-Through-Tweets
This is a sentiment classifier that would be able to predict if a person is suffering from depression with a reasonable degree of accuracy by analyzing that particular person's tweets for any markers of depression that the model will learn over time.

We have performed a comparative analysis between different neural network architectures like LSTM, CNN, GRU etc. with different types of embeddings: word, character and subword.

See the report for further details.
